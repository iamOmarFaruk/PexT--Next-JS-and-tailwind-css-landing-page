## **Code Style and Approach**

This project reflects my commitment to clean, professional, and scalable code. Here's how I've structured the project:

1. **TypeScript for Reliability**:
   - All props and shared structures are strictly typed using `types.ts`.
   - Errors are caught early during development, ensuring bug-free code.

2. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Dynamic data and reusable structures are stored in `data.ts` for centralized updates.
   - Presentation logic is abstracted into functional components for better maintainability.

3. **Tailwind CSS for Styling**:
   - Every component uses utility-first classes for quick and consistent styling.
   - Dark mode and hover states are considered throughout.

4. **Focus on Readability**:
   - Intuitive file naming and comments help developers navigate and understand the project easily.
   - Adherence to DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles.
